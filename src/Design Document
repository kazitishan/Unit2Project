LinearEquation class
Instance Variables:
private int x1 - This variable represents the first x-coordinate
private int y1 - This variable represents the first y-coordinate
private int x2 - This variable represents the second x-coordinate
private int y2 - This variable represents the second y-coordinate
private int rise - Represents the amount in rise
private int run - Represents the amount in run

Constructor
public LinearEquation(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)
Will set all instance variables to the parameters inputted (using this.xOne)

Methods

private double slope()
returns the slope of the instance

private int yIntercept()
returns the y-intercept of the instance

private string slopeInterceptForm()
returns the slope intercept form of the instance

private double distance()
returns the distance between the two points

public String toString()
This method will display all relevant information about this
instance including:
- X and Y coordinate information
- Slope by calling slope()
- y-intercept by calling yIntercept()
- Slope Intercept Form equation by calling slopeInterceptForm()
- Distance by calling distance()

public String solvedCoordinatePoint(int xValue)
returns the solved coordinate plane point based on the inputted x-value

EquationRunner.java
Step 1: Ask user to enter first coordinate point
Step 2: Ask user to enter second coordinate point
Step 3: Parse out the x and y values
Step 4: Make a new object called slopeEquation by calling the LinearEquation constructor
Step 5: Call slopeEquation.toString() to print out the information of the instance
Step 6: Ask user to input an x-value
Step 7: Print out the solved coordinate point by using solvedCoordinatePoint(int xValue)
