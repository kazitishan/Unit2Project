LinearEquation class
Instance Variables:
private int xOne - This variable represents the first x-coordinate
private int yOne - This variable represents the first y-coordinate
private int xTwo - This variable represents the second x-coordinate
private int yTwo - This variable represents the second y-coordinate

Constructor
public LinearEquation(int xOne, int yOne, int xTwo, int yTwo)
Will set all instance variables to the parameters inputted (using this.xOne)

Methods

private double slope()
returns the slope of the instance

private int yIntercept()
returns the y-intercept of the instance

private string slopeInterceptForm()
returns the slope intercept form of the instance

public void String toString()
This method will display all relevant information about this
instance including:
- X and Y coordinate information
- Slope by calling slope()
- y-intercept by calling yIntercept
- Slope Intercept Form equation by calling slopeInterceptForm()

public String solvedCoordinatePoint(int xValue)
returns the solved coordinate plane point based on the inputted x-value

EquationRunner.java
Step 1: Ask user to enter first coordinate point
Step 2: Ask user to enter second coordinate point
Step 3: Parse out the x and y values
Step 4: Make a new object called slopeEquation by calling the LinearEquation constructor
Step 5: Call slopeEquation.toString() to print out the information of the instance
Step 6: Ask user to input an x-value
Step 7: Print out the solved coordinate point by using solvedCoordinatePoint(int xValue)
